'''
i have to find the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the given array
How to do that ?
1. I will iterate through the array and check if the current element is 1 or not
2. if it is 1 then i will increase the count by 1
3. if it is not 1 then i will check if the current count is greater than the max count or not
4. if it is greater then i will update the max count
5. i will reset the count to 0
6. at the end i will return the max count
